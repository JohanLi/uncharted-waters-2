## Ships

Outside of the stats shown in-game, each type of ship also have a
"sail type". This affects how their speed are affected by wind: some
cannot handle headwind well, while others sail just as fast in headwind
as tailwind.

There are a total of 8 sail types, of which only the 6 first are used.
Uncharted Waters: New Horizons uses 8 directions.

Below is a table with the sail type on the x-axis and the wind direction
on the y-axis. Direction 0, the first row, is tailwind while direction 4
is headwind.

For instance, Buss and Galleon have sail type 0 which is affected the
most by headwind. Caravela Latina and Light Galley have sail type 5,
behaving the same in headwind as tailwind.
