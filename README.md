# Uncharted Waters 2

[Uncharted Waters 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncharted_Waters#Uncharted_Waters:_New_Horizons)
is an open world RPG and simulation game, set during the Age of Exploration
and released by Koei in 1994. Being the favorite game of my childhood,
I have chosen to remake this game using web technologies as a side
project.
